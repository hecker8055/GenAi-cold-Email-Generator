# ðŸ“§ Cold Mail Generator
This is an AI-powered cold email generator built for service-based companies looking to reach out to potential clients based on their job listings.
It uses LangChain, GROQ, Streamlit, and a vector database to extract job roles from company careers pages and automatically generate personalized cold emails with relevant portfolio links.

**Imagine a scenario:**

Tesla is actively expanding its autonomy team and is hiring for the role of Senior AI/ML Engineer. Rather than going through a lengthy hiring process, ByteForge, an AI consultancy, sees an opportunity to step in.

Priya, a business development executive at ByteForge, uses the Cold Email Generator to craft a highly personalized outreach email to Tesla. The tool analyzes the job description from Tesla's careers page and automatically suggests relevant portfolio projects where ByteForge has successfully deployed transformer-based models for automotive applications.

This allows Priya to quickly send a compelling cold email offering pre-vetted AI experts who can seamlessly integrate with Teslaâ€™s autonomy teamâ€”saving Tesla time and resources while positioning ByteForge as a valuable partner.
